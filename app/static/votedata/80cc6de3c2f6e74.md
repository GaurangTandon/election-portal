# Audit of `token`

The given token proof is: `80cc6de3c2f6e74c944e52f6a1a00a8dce1c93dc845b3427d4afe78c87709685`. This file contains information on how to audit this token. Through this auditing, you will be guaranteed that this token proof is a genuine representation of the original vote choices.
We used the SHA256 hashing algorithm. You can run it on Linux as `echo -n "<string>" | sha256sum`
We added nonces to the strings (before hashing them) to make it impossible to reverse-engineer the string to match the hash. Each nonce is a 16 byte random integer.

The given token encodes 1 preferences

## Preference 1

The unique key of the candidate is: `2018101091`, and the nonce attached to it is: `f8b2890e82d9e671`. This yields the combined string: `2018101091,f8b2890e82d9e671`
The hash of the above combined string is: `253bded8bf8a49b0413b68c470e47d8b99571c3e08eacdc50ece72dfe3314e38`

## Combining all hashes

The combined string of all hashes is: `253bded8bf8a49b0413b68c470e47d8b99571c3e08eacdc50ece72dfe3314e38,5a5aab2115b8260c`
Using the nonce: `5a5aab2115b8260c`, the final string of all hashes obtained is: `253bded8bf8a49b0413b68c470e47d8b99571c3e08eacdc50ece72dfe3314e38,5a5aab2115b8260c`
Hashing the above final string gives the final hash: `80cc6de3c2f6e74c944e52f6a1a00a8dce1c93dc845b3427d4afe78c87709685`. This final hash is the same as the token proof that was assigned to you.

## Conclusion

We have successfully audited the internal representation of the given token proof.
