# Audit of `token`

The given token proof is: `522cbaac94f2d93248303d1b687767007cb19067665851fce6705767d6955cc0`. This file contains information on how to audit this token. Through this auditing, you will be guaranteed that this token proof is a genuine representation of the original vote choices.
We used the SHA256 hashing algorithm. You can run it on Linux as `echo -n "<string>" | sha256sum`
We added nonces to the strings (before hashing them) to make it impossible to reverse-engineer the string to match the hash. Each nonce is a 16 byte random integer.

The given token encodes 1 preferences

## Preference 1

The unique key of the candidate is: `2018`, and the nonce attached to it is: `c07ffb32fc1ca6b3`. This yields the combined string: `2018,c07ffb32fc1ca6b3`
The hash of the above combined string is: `bb33d4b062414eb1bf3134b115d045382525902721d545f5076e5c030c0d6f5d`

## Combining all hashes

The combined string of all hashes is: `bb33d4b062414eb1bf3134b115d045382525902721d545f5076e5c030c0d6f5d,3c7c88524caa1b23`
Using the nonce: `3c7c88524caa1b23`, the final string of all hashes obtained is: `bb33d4b062414eb1bf3134b115d045382525902721d545f5076e5c030c0d6f5d,3c7c88524caa1b23`

Hashing the above final string gives the final hash: `522cbaac94f2d93248303d1b687767007cb19067665851fce6705767d6955cc0`. This final hash is the same as the token proof that was assigned to you.

## Conclusion

We have successfully audited the internal representation of the given token proof.
