# Audit of `token`

The given token proof is: `0ec2f5987ed67e8b1d934a2c4b8cf06eda701d95d114da120b1fe21b6e22da20`. This file contains information on how to audit this token. Through this auditing, you will be guaranteed that this token proof is a genuine representation of the original vote choices.
We used the SHA256 hashing algorithm. You can run it on Linux as `echo -n "<string>" | sha256sum`
We added nonces to the strings (before hashing them) to make it impossible to reverse-engineer the string to match the hash. Each nonce is a 16 byte random integer.

The given token encodes 1 preferences

## Preference 1

The unique key of the candidate is: `2018`, and the nonce attached to it is: `f7f14ecdc921c539`. This yields the combined string: `2018,f7f14ecdc921c539`
The hash of the above combined string is: `5ec7d29d8fbb22d9487fb5ce55ce08846a9e55d30dba24a798becfb57906962b`

## Combining all hashes

The combined string of all hashes is: `5ec7d29d8fbb22d9487fb5ce55ce08846a9e55d30dba24a798becfb57906962b,0ea18a9708110941`
Using the nonce: `0ea18a9708110941`, the final string of all hashes obtained is: `5ec7d29d8fbb22d9487fb5ce55ce08846a9e55d30dba24a798becfb57906962b,0ea18a9708110941`

Hashing the above final string gives the final hash: `0ec2f5987ed67e8b1d934a2c4b8cf06eda701d95d114da120b1fe21b6e22da20`. This final hash is the same as the token proof that was assigned to you.

## Conclusion

We have successfully audited the internal representation of the given token proof.
