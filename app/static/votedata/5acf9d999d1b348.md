# Audit of `token`

The given token proof is: `5acf9d999d1b348c7750d7af44988cbb207b2948255254ca0cb6e21d44f41bf2`. This file contains information on how to audit this token. Through this auditing, you will be guaranteed that this token proof is a genuine representation of the original vote choices.
We used the SHA256 hashing algorithm. You can run it on Linux as `echo -n "<string>" | sha256sum`
We added nonces to the strings (before hashing them) to make it impossible to reverse-engineer the string to match the hash. Each nonce is a 16 byte random integer.

The given token encodes 1 preferences

## Preference 1

The unique key of the candidate is: `2018`, and the nonce attached to it is: `935d19a3e6378a64`. This yields the combined string: `2018,935d19a3e6378a64`
The hash of the above combined string is: `6ad6ee3a691ae3b9cb42ec4feb96700fbccf61819230fc7866b87d5b8ae272bf`

## Combining all hashes

The combined string of all hashes is: `6ad6ee3a691ae3b9cb42ec4feb96700fbccf61819230fc7866b87d5b8ae272bf,0c5ca6736b431c56`
Using the nonce: `0c5ca6736b431c56`, the final string of all hashes obtained is: `6ad6ee3a691ae3b9cb42ec4feb96700fbccf61819230fc7866b87d5b8ae272bf,0c5ca6736b431c56`

Hashing the above final string gives the final hash: `5acf9d999d1b348c7750d7af44988cbb207b2948255254ca0cb6e21d44f41bf2`. This final hash is the same as the token proof that was assigned to you.

## Conclusion

We have successfully audited the internal representation of the given token proof.
