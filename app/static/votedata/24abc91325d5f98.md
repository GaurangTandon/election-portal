# Audit of `token`

The given token proof is: `24abc91325d5f989fb1e84798221b70b8bc5df04c418ba7fa04f80cefb7fe0f2`. This file contains information on how to audit this token. Through this auditing, you will be guaranteed that this token proof is a genuine representation of the original vote choices.
We used the SHA256 hashing algorithm. You can run it on Linux as `echo -n "<string>" | sha256sum`
We added nonces to the strings (before hashing them) to make it impossible to reverse-engineer the string to match the hash. Each nonce is a 16 byte random integer.

The given token encodes 1 preferences

## Preference 1

The unique key of the candidate is: `2018`, and the nonce attached to it is: `1b8e76453622a97f`. This yields the combined string: `2018,1b8e76453622a97f`
The hash of the above combined string is: `2c10d2f6bc3a5b3fc98ecb88514cd4c8303158df34e0490db416bb4a96700e03`

## Combining all hashes

The combined string of all hashes is: `2c10d2f6bc3a5b3fc98ecb88514cd4c8303158df34e0490db416bb4a96700e03,05ae6132755487c3`
Using the nonce: `05ae6132755487c3`, the final string of all hashes obtained is: `2c10d2f6bc3a5b3fc98ecb88514cd4c8303158df34e0490db416bb4a96700e03,05ae6132755487c3`

Hashing the above final string gives the final hash: `24abc91325d5f989fb1e84798221b70b8bc5df04c418ba7fa04f80cefb7fe0f2`. This final hash is the same as the token proof that was assigned to you.

## Conclusion

We have successfully audited the internal representation of the given token proof.
