# Audit of `token`

The given token proof is: `4afa1507b4e2026ce512cd271f0530233dcf9b5f195cac2f726475c76149a55c`. This file contains information on how to audit this token. Through this auditing, you will be guaranteed that this token proof is a genuine representation of the original vote choices.
We used the SHA256 hashing algorithm. You can run it on Linux as `echo -n "<string>" | sha256sum`
We added nonces to the strings (before hashing them) to make it impossible to reverse-engineer the string to match the hash. Each nonce is a 16 byte random integer.

The given token encodes 1 preferences

## Preference 1

The unique key of the candidate is: `2018`, and the nonce attached to it is: `889d07ff5f3777de`. This yields the combined string: `2018,889d07ff5f3777de`
The hash of the above combined string is: `4d6a2b69088f173c1a87347dca4bae2174eec8f227db4d0aa1e7efae2790f6ab`

## Combining all hashes

The combined string of all hashes is: `4d6a2b69088f173c1a87347dca4bae2174eec8f227db4d0aa1e7efae2790f6ab,4849788af9559180`
Using the nonce: `4849788af9559180`, the final string of all hashes obtained is: `4d6a2b69088f173c1a87347dca4bae2174eec8f227db4d0aa1e7efae2790f6ab,4849788af9559180`

Hashing the above final string gives the final hash: `4afa1507b4e2026ce512cd271f0530233dcf9b5f195cac2f726475c76149a55c`. This final hash is the same as the token proof that was assigned to you.

## Conclusion

We have successfully audited the internal representation of the given token proof.
