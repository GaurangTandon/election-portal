# Audit of `token`

The given token proof is: `017bda47f18c8fca23ea21398729b96815b37da2fad42249e48c3678dd6c4170`. This file contains information on how to audit this token. Through this auditing, you will be guaranteed that this token proof is a genuine representation of the original vote choices.
We used the SHA256 hashing algorithm. You can run it on Linux as `echo -n "<string>" | sha256sum`
We added nonces to the strings (before hashing them) to make it impossible to reverse-engineer the string to match the hash. Each nonce is a 16 byte random integer.

The given token encodes 1 preferences

## Preference 1

The unique key of the candidate is: `2018`, and the nonce attached to it is: `226c4c697681128c`. This yields the combined string: `2018,226c4c697681128c`
The hash of the above combined string is: `59aaf0540586a851af8fd346598804e8b09ff3e1a49bb659dc0333f705e6f89f`

## Combining all hashes

The combined string of all hashes is: `59aaf0540586a851af8fd346598804e8b09ff3e1a49bb659dc0333f705e6f89f,1c258eb2712bc3b0`
Using the nonce: `1c258eb2712bc3b0`, the final string of all hashes obtained is: `59aaf0540586a851af8fd346598804e8b09ff3e1a49bb659dc0333f705e6f89f,1c258eb2712bc3b0`

Hashing the above final string gives the final hash: `017bda47f18c8fca23ea21398729b96815b37da2fad42249e48c3678dd6c4170`. This final hash is the same as the token proof that was assigned to you.

## Conclusion

We have successfully audited the internal representation of the given token proof.
