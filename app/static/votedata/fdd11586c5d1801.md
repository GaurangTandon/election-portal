# Audit of `token`

The given token proof is: `fdd11586c5d1801d11f73980d96024ed3215c16be9c7e86ed6755aacc9b22b8f`. This file contains information on how to audit this token. Through this auditing, you will be guaranteed that this token proof is a genuine representation of the original vote choices.
We used the SHA256 hashing algorithm. You can run it on Linux as `echo -n "<string>" | sha256sum`
We added nonces to the strings (before hashing them) to make it impossible to reverse-engineer the string to match the hash. Each nonce is a 16 byte random integer.

The given token encodes 1 preferences

## Preference 1

The unique key of the candidate is: `2018`, and the nonce attached to it is: `0eda2c9c0513ca12`. This yields the combined string: `2018,0eda2c9c0513ca12`
The hash of the above combined string is: `1d7e0558f7fe0f9db8d8ac9423758774e79da0667dbf7ae710c93c3227b0d93e`

## Combining all hashes

The combined string of all hashes is: `1d7e0558f7fe0f9db8d8ac9423758774e79da0667dbf7ae710c93c3227b0d93e,4341e204454b4ee8`
Using the nonce: `4341e204454b4ee8`, the final string of all hashes obtained is: `1d7e0558f7fe0f9db8d8ac9423758774e79da0667dbf7ae710c93c3227b0d93e,4341e204454b4ee8`
Hashing the above final string gives the final hash: `fdd11586c5d1801d11f73980d96024ed3215c16be9c7e86ed6755aacc9b22b8f`. This final hash is the same as the token proof that was assigned to you.

## Conclusion

We have successfully audited the internal representation of the given token proof.
